Classification methods (methods predicting categorical labels)
Main article: Statistical classification

Parametric:[25]

    Linear discriminant analysis
    Quadratic discriminant analysis
    Maximum entropy classifier (aka logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression): Note that logistic regression is an algorithm for classification, despite its name. (The name comes from the fact that logistic regression uses an extension of a linear regression model to model the probability of an input being in a particular class.)

Nonparametric:[26]

    Decision trees, decision lists
    Kernel estimation and K-nearest-neighbor algorithms
    Naive Bayes classifier
    Neural networks (multi-layer perceptrons)
    Perceptrons
    Support vector machines
    Gene expression programming

Clustering methods (methods for classifying and predicting categorical labels)
Main article: Cluster analysis

    Categorical mixture models
    Hierarchical clustering (agglomerative or divisive)
    K-means clustering
